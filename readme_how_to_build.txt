Disclaimer : 

	The c++ in these examples is aiming to be readable, helpful and simple.
	I may or may not have broken rules of c++ syntax or methodology. If there are improvements to	
	be made by all means - send them to me and i will amend the code and posts. 

	The goal is the see the least possible code to understand what it is doing, not to
	be the least error prone, fastest or most indestructible code around.


For running the examples :

	Each example has its own script file, named appropriately.
	Each example has a batch file, which will execute that file, and wait for a key.

	To understand what the point of the script is, read the comments in the C++ file.


For building the examples : 

	I have included everything you need to build the examples,
	including a trunk revision of v8.lib which was compiled against vs2008.

	Step 1) Inside ./v8/ Unzip the v8.zip into the same directory. 
                Make sure that v8/v8.lib is there - and the samples should build as is.

        Step 2) Open v8examples_vs2008.sln in Vs2008 or VC2008 express.

	Step 3) Fiddle with stuff.

	Step 4) Build and test.



Licence etc:

	Google v8 has its own licences, see http://code.google.com/p/v8

	These examples and sources - MIT Licence. Do what you want with it, spread it wide and far.



I hope these help you, as i wish i had something like this when i first got v8 :)
